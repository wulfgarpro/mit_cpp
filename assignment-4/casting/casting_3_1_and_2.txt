3.1 
    A static cast between two types does compile checking for correctness but doesn't provide run-time guarentee through checking.
        Triangle* tri = static_cast<Triangle*>(rect);

3.2
    Dynamic cast does provide run-time checking of types but, conversely, no compile time checking.
        Triangle* tri = dynamic_cast<Triangle*>(rect);
