3.1 
    A reinterpret_cast will do a potentially unsafe cast between siblings without any runtime checking 
        Triangle* tri = reinterpret_cast<Triangle*>(rect);

3.2
    Dynamic cast does provide run-time checking of types and is the best choice when casting between pointers/references of polymorphic types
        Triangle* tri = dynamic_cast<Triangle*>(rect);
